So if we imagine a ball on top of a hill, we want it to drop at a certain rate so as to converge on an optimal value at the bottom of the hill. If it drops too fast, it could bounce all over the landscape, never resting at the point we want it to rest at. The rate of descent is analogous to our learning rate.\n",
